									<h4>Screens | Maximizing Your Visual Experience</h4>
									<p>The screen isn't just a canvas for projecting images; it's a crucial player in your home theater experience. While resolution, brightness, color depth, and contrast ratio are vital features of your projector, the screen's gain and form factor significantly influence the end visual result.</p>
								</Col>
							</Row>
							<Row>
								<Col sm={12}>
									<h4>Understanding Screen Gain</h4>
									<p>Screen gain refers to the amount of light that a screen reflects back. A higher gain screen will reflect more light and appear brighter, but it may limit viewing angles. On the other hand, a lower gain screen will provide wider viewing angles but may appear dimmer. High-gain screens excel in dedicated, front-aligned rooms, while low-gain screens suit multi-purpose rooms. However, the latter requires a bright projector or natural light control capabilities to perform optimally. Similarly, choosing any particular form factor will depend on the intended room usage and environmental conditions.</p>

									<h4>Form Factor Options</h4>

							<Row>
								<Col md={6}>
									<div className="box border rounded-1 p-4">
										<h5>Fixed Frame Screens</h5>
										<p>These screens provide a theater-like experience with a flat, tensioned surface, ensuring a uniformly smooth and wrinkle-free viewing area. Perfect for dedicated theater rooms with controlled lighting.</p>
									</div>
								</Col>
								<Col md={6}>
									<div className="box border rounded-1 p-4">
										<h5>Motorized Screens</h5>
										<p>These screens are retractable, perfect for multi-use rooms where a permanent screen might not be desirable. They can be hidden when not in use and lowered at the touch of a button when it's showtime.</p>
									</div>
								</Col>
								<Col md={6}>
									<div className="box border rounded-1 p-4">
										<h5>Acoustically Transparent Screens</h5>
										<p>These screens allow sound to pass through from speakers placed behind the screen, preserving the illusion of sound coming directly from the action on the screen. Ideal for cinematic experiences aiming for the highest audio and visual synchronization levels.</p>
									</div>
								</Col>
								<Col md={6}>
									<div className="box border rounded-1 p-4">
										<h5>Ambient Light Rejecting (ALR) Screens</h5>
										<p>These screens are designed to maximize picture performance in bright environments, reflecting the projector's light while absorbing ambient light. Perfect for rooms with high ambient light or where complete light control isn't possible.</p>

									<h4>Audio Equipment | Immersing You in Sound</h4>
									<p>The Audio-Visual Receiver, or AVR, is at the center of any high-quality home theater system. The hub where everything connects and synergizes. Your media sources, whether a Blu-ray player, a game console, or a streaming device, first connect to the AVR. The AVR then decodes the audio and video signals from these sources and delivers them to the right output: the video signals to your projector and the audio signals to your speakers. It's a balance of power and precision, acting like a maestro conducting an orchestra when choosing the right paths for each signal without you having to worry about compatibility issues.</p>
									<p>But choosing an AVR starts with a basic consideration: the speaker setup. It can vary widely depending on your room and preferences. A simple stereo setup involves just two speakers, offering a left and a right audio channel. A more complex setup would start with adding a subwoofer, a specialized speaker for low frequencies, and it becomes a 2.1 setup (left + right, and the subwoofer). Or a 3.1 setup (left, right, center, and the subwoofer). Adding more and more speakers, we would have 5.1, 7.1, 9.1, or even 11.1 setups. The substantial difference between those increasing numbers will be improving a sense of space from the sounds surrounding the scene you are viewing. But here are some important notes:</p>
									<ul className="list">
										<li><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCircleRight} />  Surround sound is the name that encompasses very different technologies that aim to achieve that spatial effect.</li>
										<li><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCircleRight} />  In the case of multi-channel, multi-speaker technologies (we'll talk about the most renowned in a few), no additional speakers will work unless the source and its audio content have those extra channels encoded. If you only have a stereo source or track, you will not get any additional sense of a virtual surrounding space from 5, 7, or 11 speakers.</li>
									</ul>

									<div className="img py-3">
										<img src={require('../img/front/dolby-digital.png')} alt="dolby digital" loading="lazy" />
									</div>
									<p>To explain these further, let's talk about surround sound technologies. Even if you have no clue about it, mostly sure you are already familiar with Dolby Digital audio, which has a recognizable icon. Maybe you saw it at the end of your favorite movie, in the case of its Blu-Ray disc, or when selecting content on your media streaming device. You will find a label close to it stating the number of channels, like 5.1. If you find this information frequently on the content you like to consume, you are ready to enjoy the benefits of a surround setup. Dolby Digital offers a 2D kind of surround, meaning you can imagine your head as a point in a plane surrounded by the scene effects. Other technologies. like DTS:X and Auro-3D can simulate a 3D space. Dolby Atmos, for instance, does it by bringing overhead speakers into the mix, creating a 3D sound field. This means you can hear a helicopter not just from your front, rear, and side speakers (like in a 5.1 or 7.1 setup) but seeming to fly overhead, gradually crossing all the speakers in a 9.1 or 11.1 setup.</p>

									<h4>Lighting &amp; Shades | Mastering the Mood</h4>
									<p>A great cinematic experience extends far beyond just the screen. The right mix of lighting fixtures strategically placed and synchronously operated can amplify the overall mood and ambiance. Imagine your room bathed in a soft glow of recessed lights dimming as the projector warms up or LED stripes subtly illuminate the aisle and chairs for easy low-light movement. Picture a stunning cove light casting a soft indirect glow on the ceiling, paired with tastefully placed sconces on the walls, augmenting the architectural aesthetics of your home theater. Or top the place with star-like LEDs in the ceiling rhythmically twinkling, almost breathing, replicating a night sky for an open-air theater feel.</p>
									<p>Every lighting element meticulously chosen, positioned, and calibrated, setting the stage for your perfect cinematic evening. It's not just about how much light is in the room but where that light is and how it interacts with the space around you.</p>
									<p>The true magic lies in commanding the illumination ambiance in your home theater with just a few taps. Enter lighting controls. Wall-mounted keypads and dimmers bring the power of lighting control to your fingertips. These state-of-the-art devices allow you to create and recall presets for different activities, whether an intense action film requiring a darkened environment or a romantic comedy accompanied by a warm and cozy glow. We offer a diverse palette of materials and finishes to fit your own style.</p>
									<p>Lastly, the role of shades and screen curtains in your home theater cannot be understated. Automated shades provide necessary light control, blocking out any ambient light that might interfere with the viewing experience. Similarly, the screen curtains opening and closing at the start and end of each movie can replicate an authentic cinema experience at home, enhancing the magic and suspense of what's to come. In the realm of home theaters, where the aim is to create an immersive sensory experience, these small details matter and contribute significantly to achieving the perfect home cinematic experience.</p>
